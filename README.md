# Welcome to Blerg!
## The blog site for bloggers who hate blogging!

## Purpose
Okay okay, the real purpose of this site is to let me practice new skills. I figured a blog is a pretty standard concept with lots of nice pieces to work with, so I can focus on what I want to focus on without having to muddle around with a bunch of unforeseen issues unrelated to whatever thing I'm trying to learn (famous last words, I. KNOW.)

## Methods
First up, I'm learning Sass/SCSS. That means I technically need to build this site backwards, because Sass is a frontend skill. So the first version of this site is going to have a lot of placeholder text and not actually be functional until I can build the backend. But I'll pick a backend skill to learn afterward, and then Blerg! will be a REAL bloggy little blog and everyone will be happy.
